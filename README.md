# ramsis.datamodel

> Deprecation Note: This release (v0.2) is the last release before 
> reintegration into the ramsis core repository.

This namspace distribution implements the *RT-RAMSIS* data model. Data is kept
persistant by means of the `sqlalchemy` object relational mapper.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install git+https://gitlab.seismo.ethz.ch/indu/ramsis.datamodel.git
```

**Note**: It is strongly recommended to install this distribution into an
isolated (*virtual*) Python environment. A virtual environment is created by
means of e.g. the [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) package.

## License

`ramsis` namespace distributions are licensed under the [*AGPL* license]
(https://gitlab.seismo.ethz.ch/indu/rt-ramsis/blob/master/LICENSE) to be
compatible with some of the libraries we use.
